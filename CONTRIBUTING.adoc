Whenever you want to commit a change to the skupper-router repo, please first create a PR so it can be reviewed and approved by others.
When creating a PR, please use the following commit message pattern

```
Fixed #<github-issue-number>: <Commit message>
```

For example,

```
Fixed #90: Fixed code in http2 adaptor that was doing improper q2 related logging
```

In the above commit message, `#90` refers to the github issue - https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-router/issues/90 (you will need to create an issue if there isn't already one)

After the PR is approved, please use the Github PR "Squash and merge" button  to commit your changes to the main branch.
Please refrain from directly committing your work to the main branch.
The following things happen when using the "Squash and merge" button to commit your changes:

1. The PR is automatically closed
2. The github issue `#90` is closed
3. The commit on the main branch is referenced in issue `#90`
4. There is a hyperlink to the Github issue `#90` from the commit.

For porting upstream qpid-dispatch issues to skupper-router you might use the standard `DISPATCH-XXXX: <Commit message>`  in your commit message but make sure you commit your change via the Github "Squash and merge" button.
